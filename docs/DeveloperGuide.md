## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `CampusConnectParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CampusConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CampusConnectParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Finally, the `Logic` contains the important `Command` classes. Some command classes from AB3 have been retained:
<puml src="diagrams/CommandClassesOriginal.puml" width="600"/>

However, there are new classes implemented for CampusConnect as well:
<puml src="diagrams/CommandClasses.puml" width="600"/>

The structure is simple:
* Each `Command` class (old and new) extends from the abstract `Command` class, which enforces the implementation of the `execute()` method.
* Each `Command` class contains the respective `COMMAND_WORD` representing the name of the command and a `MESSAGE_USAGE` string to demonstrate how to use the respective command.
* They also contain their own respective error messages.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the CampusConnect data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `CampusConnect`, which `Person` references. This allows `CampusConnect` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/CampusConnect/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CampusConnect data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `CampusConnectStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCampusConnect`. It extends `CampusConnect` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `history` and `future`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCampusConnect#saveCurrentData()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current CampusConnect state in its future.
*  `VersionedCampusConnect#saveOldData()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current CampusConnect state in its history.
* `VersionedCampusConnect#extractOldData()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous CampusConnect state from its history.
* `VersionedCampusConnect#extractUndoneData()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone CampusConnect state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveCurrentCampusConnect()`, `Model#undoCampusConnect()` and `Model#redoCampusConnect()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCampusConnect` will be initialized with two stacks.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the CampusConnect. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveCurrentCampusConnect()`, causing the modified state of the CampusConnect after the `delete 5` command executes to be displayed and the old state of CampusConnect to be saved to the history.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#saveCurrentCampusConnect()`, causing the modified state of the CampusConnect after the `delete 5` command executes to be displayed and the old state of CampusConnect to be saved to the history.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will call `Model#undoCampusConnect()`, so the CampusConnect state will not be saved into the `history`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCampusConnect()`, which will save the current CampusConnect state into `future` and pop the latest saved CampusConnect state from the `history`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `history` is empty, then there are no previous CampusConnect states to restore. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoCampusConnect()`, which save current state into `history` and restores the CampusConnect to that state popped from the top of `future`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `future` stack is empty, then there are no undone CampusConnect states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCampusConnect()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CampusConnect, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#saveCurrentCampusConnect()`, `Model#undoCampusConnect()` or `Model#redoCampusConnect()`. Thus, the `history` and `future` remain unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCampusConnect()`. All CampusConnectState in the future will be removed. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CampusConnect.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**
Our goal was to improve AB3 in terms of contact organisation, finding and tagging to allow for greater functionality and flexibility.

Our first major change was to modify the `find` command to accept any field as a parameter and allow multiple parameters. This was a moderate effort
that required us to change how the `FindCommand` class worked by creating new predicate classes and processing the logic for that as well,
which was aided by the given predicate classes that we used as a template, but it was not trivial.

Our next major change was the `undo` and `redo` commands, which were quite extensive to implement. We had to create the `VersionedCampusConnect` (a 
variation on the `VersionedAddressBook`) and resolve serious issues related to the undo and redo state, such as logic to process
when the `undo` and `redo` commands failed and whether non-state affecting commands (like `find`) would affect the `undo` and `redo` result. Overall,
this was quite difficult.

Finally, our last major change was the tag management and categorisation system, which was more difficult as the `undo` and `redo`. We added a tag management 
component and several commands, different types of tags, and a tag list component in the UI. Figuring out how to dynamically update the tags and the tag list 
in the GUI required a restructuring of our GUI files (under the `ui` folder) and we had faced many issues with the tag categorisation system. All in all, 
implementing this system was not easy but it did provide better tag customisation and control than AB3.

Most commands implemented used the given `Command` classes as a reference, but modified them to adapt the respective `execute()` methods for the command.
